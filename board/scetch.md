# Game Elements:

Snake – A series of segments (like a list of positions) that move in a direction.
Food – A simple item that appears at a random position. The snake grows when it eats this.
Grid – The game typically takes place on a grid. Think of it like tiles.
Game Loop – Constantly updates the game and redraws it.
Input – Arrow keys to change direction.
Collision – Snake hitting itself or the wall = Game Over.


# What to implement
1. Grid
2. Snake
3. Input system
4. Food
5. Game loop (Snake + food = growing)
6. Collision
7. Proper UI
